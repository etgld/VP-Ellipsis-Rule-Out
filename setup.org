* Setup Instructions
  - Install =conda= or if installed run =conda update -n base -c defaults conda=
  - Run =conda create -n VPE python=3.6= (Pattern (used for verb conjugation) and the BLLIP Parser don't support later versions of python).   
  - Run =conda activate VPE=           
  - Run =conda install nltk pip=
  - Run =conda install -c stanfordnlp stanza=
  - Run =conda install -c conda-forge spacy=     
  - Follow the instructions for installing the Stanford CoreNLP suite as instructed here =https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza#accessing-java-stanford-corenlp-software=
  - This might be unecessary but run =python -m pip install --upgrade pip= 
  - Run =pip install bllipparser pattern= 
  - (Unsure whether this will be used) run =pip install mlconjug=
  - Run =python -mbllipparser.ModelFetcher -l= to see the list of available models for the BLLIP Parser).    
  - Run =python -mbllipparser.ModelFetcher -i <Model Name>= to install a particular model (currently the code uses =WSJ+Gigaword=).
  - You will have to alter =rule-out.py= and =trees-latex.py= to reflect the path where you have installed the model. In the case of my linux machine the path is =/home/<username>/.local/share/bllipparser/=   
  - For Windows, building =bllipparser= is trickier, a list of builds for Windows are available here =https://github.com/BLLIP/bllip-parser#other-versions-of-the-parser=.
